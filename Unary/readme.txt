3. Start Unary.
4. Enter the AoE2 process name and click "Connect to process". The process name is normally the filename of the executable without the ".exe" part, usually "WK" for WK or "AoE2DE_s" for DE.
5. For each player you want controlled by Unary, enter the player number and click "Start for player".
