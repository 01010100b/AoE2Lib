Unary AI by 01010100
====================

Unary requires the .NET 6 framework to be installed. Unary works on AoC and WK.

Installation
------------

Unzip Unary anywhere you want except under the Program Files folder.
Copy Unary.ai and Unary.per to your AoE2 scripts folder. 

Playing a game
--------------

Perform the following steps in order:

1. Start Unary.exe

2. Click "Browse Exe Path" and select your AoE2's executable file.

3. For each player you want controlled by Unary, enter the player number and click "Start for player".

4. Start the game in AoE2. If everything works then each Unary player will chat an OK confirmation message in-game around 10-20 seconds in.

5. Click "Stop all players" to stop Unary controlling any players.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Several log files are created in Unary's folder. 
The main Unary application will write to "Unary.log" and each Unary player {p} will write to "Player {p}.log".
Please provide the relevant log files (preferably zipped, they can get quite large) when making a bug report.
